So, i've been doing this quest with my friend, we were at axelus's base in maex, (you know, the house 81 etc...) so, we've killed the 3 guards after they came in, axelus said his dialog, but my friend couldn't use the exit, doesn't matter how many times we killed those guards again and threw their token into the hopper, my friend couldn't use the exit, i could use it, hovewer it always put me in the wall every time i tried it, please fix this quest it's so annoying.
